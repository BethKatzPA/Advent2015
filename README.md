Solutions to Advent of Code 2015

Advent of Code is an advent calendar with the kinds of presents we enjoy - programming challenges.

I'm using it to bone up on my programming skills and learn new things - including how to use GitHub.

This repository will have the source code for the solutions plus the input data from the challenge.
